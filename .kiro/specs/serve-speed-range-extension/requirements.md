# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the serve speed range in the tennis serve simulator from the current 60-140 mph range to a broader 50-150 mph range. This enhancement will allow users to simulate a wider variety of tennis serves, from slower practice serves to professional-level power serves, providing more comprehensive training and analysis capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a tennis coach, I want to simulate serve speeds as low as 50 mph, so that I can analyze beginner and practice serve trajectories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user adjusts the serve speed slider THEN the system SHALL allow selection of speeds as low as 50 mph
2. WHEN a serve is simulated at 50 mph THEN the physics engine SHALL accurately calculate ball trajectory with reduced initial velocity
3. WHEN the serve speed is set to 50 mph THEN the control panel SHALL display "50 mph" as the current velocity

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a tennis analyst, I want to simulate serve speeds up to 150 mph, so that I can study professional-level power serves and their physics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user adjusts the serve speed slider THEN the system SHALL allow selection of speeds up to 150 mph
2. WHEN a serve is simulated at 150 mph THEN the physics engine SHALL accurately calculate ball trajectory with increased initial velocity
3. WHEN the serve speed is set to 150 mph THEN the control panel SHALL display "150 mph" as the current velocity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the tennis simulator, I want the extended speed range to maintain smooth slider interaction, so that I can easily select any speed within the new range.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user drags the serve speed slider THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions between 50 mph and 150 mph
2. WHEN the user releases the slider at any position THEN the system SHALL set the speed to the nearest integer value within the 50-150 mph range
3. WHEN the speed is adjusted THEN the system SHALL immediately update the displayed speed value in real-time

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the physics simulation to remain accurate across the extended speed range, so that the ball trajectories are realistic for all serve speeds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a serve is simulated at any speed between 50-150 mph THEN the physics calculations SHALL maintain accuracy for drag, magnus, and gravity effects
2. WHEN comparing serves at different speeds THEN the relative trajectory differences SHALL be physically realistic
3. WHEN the serve speed is at the extremes (50 mph or 150 mph) THEN the simulation SHALL not produce unrealistic or erratic ball behavior
